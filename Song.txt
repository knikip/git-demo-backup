sword and spear
wall of shields
standing strong
on this their chosen battle field

form the lines
shield by shield

Oh how happy
 I was there

=======================

I stand alone in the darkness
The winter of my life came so fast
Memories go back to childhood
To days I still recall

Oh, how happy I was then
There was no sorrow
There was no pain
Walking through the green fields
Sunshine in my eyes
---part 2-- 20:04

[Chorus]
I'm still there, everywhere
I'm the dust in the wind
I'm the star in the northern sky
